            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Born William Henry III is an American entrepreneur, business mogul, investor, philanthropist, and widely known as one of the most richest and influential people in the world. William Henry III was born to attorney, William Henry II and teacher, Mary Maxwell Gates in Seattle, Washington, USA.I am trying to have 3 columns all in the same horizontal line: one floated to the left, one floated to the right and one in the middle. The left and right ones should have a fixed width say of 300px and the middle one should be responsive. All three sections should have a padding just of a few px say about 6px gab between them, meaning the middle section should automatically fill the rest.</p>
